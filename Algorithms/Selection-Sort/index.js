/* Selection Sort
Write a function that assumes the first element in the array 
is also the lowest value. Then, attempt to prove this assumption
wrong. If there is a lower value, record it and place that value at the index of the first
assumed lowest value. Continue to iterate through until the entire array is sorted, lowest to highest.
Example: [50, -10, 0, -5, 20, 10, 1] = [-10, -5, 0, 1, 10, 20, 50];
Testing: `jest Selection-Sort/test.js`
