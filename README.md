## What are Data Structures?

- A way of organizing data that is stored in a computer or database.
- There are many different kinds of Data Structures.
  - Some are fast at storing and recording Data.
  - Some are fast at searching and retrieving Data.
- Each type of Data Structure represents a different way of organizing Data.
